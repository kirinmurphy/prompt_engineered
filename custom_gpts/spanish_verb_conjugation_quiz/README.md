## Test Scenarios

For each version update, verify prompt with the follwing test scenarios. For each category, answer prompt with:

- correct verb
- incorrect verb once
- incorrect verb twice
- correct verb minus the accent mark
- correct verb with a misplaced accent mark

## Current Challenges and Next Steps

- On a rare occasion there is no prompt to try again on an incorrect answer

- The missing accent warning is applied whether an accent is missing (correctly), or an accent is applied when not needed (incorrectly). Need to change messaging to be more generic.

- The quiz often starts with the same verb

<thinking>
When translating and analyzing, I should follow these steps:

1. Language identification and meaning:
   - Identify input language (English or Spanish)
   - Understand the overall meaning, accounting for tone and context
   - Consider potential ambiguities and how they affect translation

2. For English to Spanish translation:
   - Consider multiple ways to express this in Mexican Spanish
   - Ask: How would this naturally be said in Mexico? (Not textbook Spanish)
   - Consider level of formality appropriate to the context
   - Prioritize conversational expressions over literal translations
   - Note any instances where different Mexican regions would use different expressions
   - Identify if technical terminology would use a Spanish term or an English loanword
   - If slang is appropriate, determine currency/recency of slang terms

3. For Spanish to English translation:
   - Identify regional Mexican characteristics in the input
   - Note any indigenous language influences
   - Identify slang terms and their currency
   - Determine natural English equivalents that maintain the tone and register
   - Pay special attention to idiomatic expressions that lack direct equivalents

4. Grammar analysis (for Spanish text only):
   - Identify key grammatical structures present in the Spanish
   - For each structure:
     * Have I explained this structure before in this response?
     * If yes, simply list it without explanation
     * If no, provide full explanation with simple examples for complex concepts
   - Pay special attention to structures that differ significantly from English
   - Note when structure is uniquely Mexican or has a different usage in Mexico

5. Cultural and contextual analysis:
   - Identify culturally specific references
   - Note potential misunderstandings or faux pas
   - Flag profanity or vulgar expressions with appropriate warnings
   - Consider how the translation might be received in different contexts
   - For ambiguous phrases, explain multiple possible interpretations

6. Final review and formatting:
   - Ensure translations maintain appropriate formality level
   - Check that all Spanish-specific elements are properly explained
   - Format according to the output template
   - Include invitation for further questions

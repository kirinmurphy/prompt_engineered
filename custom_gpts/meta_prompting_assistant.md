# Claude System Prompt Engineering Guide

## Introduction

This guide provides a comprehensive framework for creating effective system prompts for Claude. The recommendations are based on Anthropic's best practices and are designed to help you structure prompts that maximize Claude's capabilities.

## Key Principles

1. **Use natural language framing** to establish context conversationally
2. **Create purpose-driven tags** that clearly describe their content
3. **Only use tags where helpful** for separating different content types
4. **Be flexible** - add or remove sections based on specific needs
5. **Use consistent, descriptive tag names** that indicate their content
6. **Consider nesting tags** for hierarchical content when appropriate
7. **Combine XML structure with chain of thought** for complex reasoning tasks
8. **Prefill responses** to control output format and eliminate preambles

## Core Template

To prefill Claude's response and control its output format:

```
Human: [Your prompt with instructions]

Claude: <answer>
[This text appears as the beginning of Claude's response]
```

Benefits:

- Eliminates Claude's introductory preambles
- Ensures Claude begins its response in the exact format you specify
- Saves tokens by controlling output structure
- Can be combined with the core template structure

4. **Error prevention**: Use XML tags to prevent Claude from misinterpreting instructions as part of the input:

```
# Without tags (potential misinterpretation)
Rewrite this email to be more polite but don't change anything else:
Show up at 6am tomorrow because I'm the CEO and I say so.

# With tags (clear separation)
Rewrite this email to be more polite but don't change anything else:
<email>Show up at 6am tomorrow because I'm the CEO and I say so.</email>
```

## Common Pitfalls and Solutions

### 1. Misinterpreted Instructions

**Problem**: Claude treats instructions as part of the content to be processed.

**Example**:

```
Summarize this text and identify the main themes:
The novel explores the consequences of technological advancement...
```

**Solution**: Use XML tags to clearly separate instructions from content:

```
<instructions>
Summarize this text and identify the main themes:
</instructions>

<content>
The novel explores the consequences of technological advancement...
</content>
```

### 2. Inconsistent Tag Usage

**Problem**: Mixing different tag names for the same purpose causes confusion.

**Example**:

```
<text>
[First piece of content]
</text>

<content>
[Second piece of content]
</content>
```

**Solution**: Use consistent tag names throughout your prompts:

```
<content>
[First piece of content]
</content>

<content>
[Second piece of content]
</content>
```

### 3. Missing Closing Tags

**Problem**: Forgetting to close tags can cause Claude to misinterpret where sections end.

**Solution**: Always include both opening and closing tags, and double-check that they match exactly:

```
<content>
[Content goes here]
</content>
```

### 4. Overly Complex Nesting

**Problem**: Deeply nested tags can become difficult for Claude to process correctly.

**Example**:

```
<analysis>
  <section>
    <subsection>
      <paragraph>
        <sentence>
          [Content]
        </sentence>
      </paragraph>
    </subsection>
  </section>
</analysis>
```

**Solution**: Keep nesting to a reasonable depth (typically 3-4 levels maximum):

```
<analysis>
  <section_1>
    [Content]
  </section_1>
  <section_2>
    [Content]
  </section_2>
</analysis>
```

## Advanced Techniques

### 1. Multi-shot Examples with XML Structure

For tasks where you want Claude to learn from examples, structure both the examples and desired output format with XML tags:

```
You are a language translator converting English to French.

<examples>
  <example>
    <english>Hello, how are you today?</english>
    <french>Bonjour, comment allez-vous aujourd'hui?</french>
  </example>
  <example>
    <english>I would like to order dinner.</english>
    <french>Je voudrais commander le d√Æner.</french>
  </example>
</examples>

<input>
Where is the nearest train station?
</input>

<output_format>
Please provide the translation in this format:
<french>[French translation]</french>
</output_format>
```

### 2. Combining XML with Variable Placeholders

For templates that need to be reused with different inputs, combine XML structure with variable placeholders:

```
You are a legal document analyzer.

<contract>
{{CONTRACT_TEXT}}
</contract>

<legal_standards>
{{LEGAL_STANDARDS}}
</legal_standards>

<instructions>
1. Analyze the contract provided in the <contract> tags
2. Identify any clauses that may conflict with the standards in <legal_standards>
3. For each potential issue, explain the conflict and suggest alternative language
</instructions>

<format>
{
  "compliant": true/false,
  "issues": [
    {
      "clause": "[clause reference]",
      "conflict": "[explanation]",
      "suggestion": "[alternative language]"
    }
  ]
}
</format>
```

### 3. Context Windowing for Long Documents

For working with long documents that exceed Claude's processing capabilities, use XML tags to create "windows" into specific parts of the document:

```
You are analyzing a lengthy legal document. I will provide sections with XML tags.

<current_section>
[Content of the current section being analyzed]
</current_section>

<previous_context>
[Brief summary of relevant preceding content]
</previous_context>

<instructions>
Analyze the <current_section> in the context of <previous_context> and identify:
1. Key legal provisions
2. Potential ambiguities
3. Cross-references to other sections
</instructions>
```

## Putting It All Together: Complete System Prompt Template

Here's a comprehensive template incorporating all best practices:

```
[Brief natural language introduction establishing Claude's role and context]

<system>
You are a [specific role] tasked with [general purpose].
Your primary objective is to [main goal].
</system>

<context>
[Background information needed to understand the task]
</context>

<input>
[The specific content being worked with]
</input>

<examples>
  <example>
    <sample_input>[Example input]</sample_input>
    <sample_output>[Example output]</sample_output>
    <explanation>[Why this is a good response]</explanation>
  </example>
</examples>

<instructions>
1. [First instruction]
2. [Second instruction]
3. [Third instruction]
...
</instructions>

<thinking>
Please work through this [task] step-by-step:
1. First, [initial analysis step]
2. Then, [intermediate reasoning step]
3. Finally, [concluding analysis step]
</thinking>

<format>
[Example or description of how you want the output structured]
</format>

Claude: <answer>
[Prefilled response that sets the output format]
</answer>
```

## Evaluation and Iteration

After creating a system prompt using this template, follow these steps to ensure optimal performance:

1. **Test with varied inputs**: Try the prompt with different inputs to ensure it handles edge cases.

2. **Analyze failures**: When Claude's responses don't meet expectations, identify which part of the prompt could be improved.

3. **Iterate on tag structure**: Experiment with different tag organizations to find what works best for your specific use case.

4. **Compare performance**: Test variants of your prompt to identify which structures produce the best results.

5. **Simplify when possible**: Remove unnecessary complexity that doesn't improve performance.

## Summary of Best Practices

1. **Use natural language introduction** to establish context
2. **Create descriptive, purpose-driven tags** that clearly indicate their content
3. **Only use tags where necessary** for separation of content types
4. **Maintain consistency** in tag naming throughout prompts
5. **Keep nesting reasonable** (3-4 levels maximum)
6. **Combine XML with chain-of-thought** for complex reasoning
7. **Prefill responses** to control output format
8. **Provide examples** within XML structure for better learning
9. **Test and iterate** to optimize performance

Remember that simpler is often better - use only the tags necessary for your specific task rather than including every possible section in this template.
